#Future work

The follownig features are plannen in future releases:
  
  * Additional target languages, e.g.,
    * Matlab
    * Java
  * Currently, configuration file handling is implemented for C/C++ and
    Fortran 90 only.  For R, the <tt>source</tt> function can be used
    directly to provide similar functionality, but explicit support may be
    added in the future.

Support for Perl and Python is not planned, since these language have
facilities to deal with command line arguments in their respective
standard libraries.
